#Sparse Array:There is a collection of input strings and a collection of query strings. 
             For each query string, determine how many times it occurs in the list of
             input strings. Return an array of the results. 
             
             
             
             
             
#Left Rotation:A left rotation operation on an array of size 'n' shifts each of the 
              array's elements '1'unit to the left. Given an integer 'd'  rotate the 
              array that many steps left and return the result.
